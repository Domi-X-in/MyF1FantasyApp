# Prediction Lock Implementation - Keep Predictions Visible Until Results Submitted

## 🎯 Overview
Implemented a feature to keep prediction submissions locked and visible even when the race date and time has passed, until race results are submitted. This ensures users can always see their predictions and follow them up, providing better transparency and user experience.

## 🔧 Core Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Race Status Logic

**Modified `getUpcomingRace()` function:**
- **Before**: Race was "upcoming" only if it hadn't started yet
- **After**: Race is "upcoming" if it hasn't started OR if it has started but no results are submitted yet
- **Logic**: `!race.isCompleted && (!raceHasStarted || (raceHasStarted && !hasResults))`

**Modified `getCompletedRaces()` function:**
- **Before**: Race was "completed" if it had results OR race start time had passed
- **After**: Race is "completed" if it has results OR (race start time has passed AND race is marked as completed)
- **Logic**: `hasResults || (race.isCompleted && raceHasStarted)`

### 2. New Prediction Lock Status System

**Added `getPredictionLockStatus()` helper function:**
- **`'open'`**: Race hasn't started, predictions can be made/edited
- **`'locked_no_results'`**: Race has started but no results submitted, predictions are locked but visible
- **`'results_available'`**: Race has results, predictions are visible with results comparison

### 3. Enhanced UI States

**Updated Fantasy Tab display logic:**
- **Open State**: Normal prediction interface with countdown
- **Locked (No Results)**: Orange warning banner with "Race in Progress!" message
- **Results Available**: Green success banner with "Results Available!" message

**Enhanced prediction display:**
- Shows prediction with appropriate lock status indicators
- Disables editing when locked but keeps prediction visible
- Clear messaging about when results will be available

### 4. Improved User Experience

**Visual Indicators:**
- 🔒 Locked (Race in Progress) - when race has started but no results
- 🔒 Predictions Locked - when race is about to start
- ✅ Results Available - when results have been submitted

**Button States:**
- "Edit Prediction" - when predictions are open
- "Race in Progress" - when race has started but no results
- "Predictions Locked" - when race is about to start
- "Update Prediction" / "Submit Prediction" - when editing/creating

## 📁 Files Modified

- Updated `getCompletedRaces()` function for consistency
- Added `getPredictionLockStatus()` helper function

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Status Messages
1. **Race in Progress**: Orange banner explaining predictions are locked until results
2. **Results Available**: Green banner indicating results are ready for comparison
3. **Predictions Locked**: Red banner for pre-race lock

### Visual States
- **Locked predictions**: Grayed out but still visible
- **Edit buttons**: Disabled with appropriate messaging
- **Driver selection**: Disabled when locked
- **Submit buttons**: Show appropriate status text

## 🔄 User Workflow

### Before Implementation:
1. User submits prediction
2. Race starts → prediction disappears from view
3. User can't see their prediction until results are submitted
4. Confusion about prediction status

### After Implementation:
1. User submits prediction
2. Race starts → prediction remains visible with "locked" status
3. User can see their prediction throughout the race
4. Clear indication when results will be available
5. Results submitted → prediction shows with accuracy comparison

## ✅ Benefits

### For Users:
- **Transparency**: Always know the status of their predictions
- **Engagement**: Can follow predictions during the race
- **Clarity**: Clear understanding of when results will be available
- **No Confusion**: Predictions don't disappear unexpectedly

### For Admins:
- **Clear Workflow**: Know they need to submit results to unlock predictions
- **Better UX**: Users aren't confused about missing predictions
- **Professional Feel**: Clear status indicators for all race states

## 🧪 Testing
