# Race-Categorized Leaderboard Implementation

## Overview
The ranking tab has been enhanced with a comprehensive race-categorized leaderboard system that provides multiple views of user performance and star distribution across races.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Four Leaderboard Views

#### Overall Leaderboard
- Shows total stars earned by each user
- Displays races participated count
- Sorts by total stars (descending), then by races participated
- Maintains the original leaderboard functionality

#### Recent Performance
- Shows performance in the last 5 races
- Displays recent stars earned and average score
- Visual grid showing individual race scores
- Star indicators for races where user won
- Sorts by recent stars earned

#### Race Breakdown
- Expandable sections for each completed race
- Shows all participants and their scores for each race
- Performance indicators (üî•‚≠êüëçüìä) based on score ranges
- Star winners highlighted with star icons
- Race filter dropdown to focus on specific races

#### Progress Chart
- Interactive line chart showing cumulative stars over time
- X-axis: Race cities ordered by date (ascending)
- Y-axis: Cumulative stars earned
- Color-coded lines for each user with legend
- Tooltip showing exact values on hover
- **Star Wins Table**: Detailed table showing star wins (‚≠ê) or no wins (-) for each race
- **Table Structure**: 
  - Row headers: User display names with ranking (usernames removed)
  - Column headers: Race cities with dates (chronological order, vertical text)
  - Cell values: ‚≠ê for star wins, - for no wins, cumulative total below
  - Total column: Accurately calculated from actual star wins
  - Sticky user column for better navigation
  - Sorted by total stars (descending)
- Responsive design for mobile devices

### 2. Data Processing

#### Enhanced Data Structure
```typescript
interface UserRaceStats {
  userId: string;
  username: string;
  name: string;
  totalStars: number;
  racesParticipated: number;
  raceBreakdown: {
    [raceId: string]: {
      raceName: string;
      raceCity: string;
      raceDate: string;
      starsEarned: number;
      score: number;
      isStarWinner: boolean;
      prediction: Positions;
      actualResults: Positions;
    }
  };
  recentPerformance: Array<{
    raceId: string;
    raceName: string;
    starsEarned: number;
    score: number;
    date: string;
  }>;
}
```

#### Key Helper Functions
- `processRaceBreakdown()`: Converts race data into user-race matrix
- `sortLeaderboard()`: Applies different sorting algorithms based on view
- `toggleRaceExpansion()`: Manages expandable race sections
- `getPerformanceIndicator()`: Returns visual indicators based on score
- `generateProgressChartData()`: Creates chart data with cumulative stars over time
- `generateStarWinsTableData()`: Creates table data showing star wins (1) or no wins (0) by race
- `generateUserColors()`: Assigns unique colors to each user for chart visualization

### 3. UI/UX Enhancements

#### Tabbed Interface
- Clean tab switching between views
- Consistent styling with app theme
- Responsive design for mobile devices

#### Interactive Elements
- Expandable race sections with click handlers
- Race filter dropdown for focused viewing
- Performance indicators and star displays
- Hover effects and transitions

#### Visual Indicators
- üî• Perfect match (30+ points)
- ‚≠ê High score (20+ points)
- üëç Good score (10+ points)
- üìä Low score (<10 points)
- Star icons for winners

### 4. State Management

#### New State Variables
```typescript
const [leaderboardView, setLeaderboardView] = useState<'overall' | 'race-breakdown' | 'recent' | 'progress-chart'>('overall');
const [selectedRaceFilter, setSelectedRaceFilter] = useState<string>('all');
const [expandedRaces, setExpandedRaces] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
const [processedLeaderboardData, setProcessedLeaderboardData] = useState<any[]>([]);
```

#### Data Processing
- Automatic processing when races or users change
- Memoized calculations for performance
- Real-time updates with existing data sync

### 5. Performance Considerations

#### Optimizations
- Data processing only when necessary
- Efficient sorting algorithms
- Minimal re-renders with proper state management
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

#### Caching
- Processed data cached in state
- Only recalculates when source data changes
- Efficient filtering and sorting

## Usage

### For Users
1. Navigate to the Ranking tab
2. Choose between Overall, Recent Performance, Race Breakdown, or Progress Chart views
3. In Race Breakdown view, use the filter to focus on specific races
4. Click on race headers to expand/collapse detailed results
5. View performance indicators and star distributions
6. In Progress Chart view, hover over lines to see exact values and use the legend to identify users

### For Admins
- All existing admin functionality preserved
- New leaderboard views provide better insights into user performance
- Race breakdown helps identify patterns and trends

### Progress Chart Data Processing
```typescript
const generateProgressChartData = () => {
  // Sort races by date (ascending)
  const completedRaces = getCompletedRaces()
    .filter(race => race.results)
    .sort((a, b) => new Date(a.date).getTime() - new Date(b.date).getTime());

  if (completedRaces.length === 0) return [];

  // First pass: calculate star wins (1) or no wins (0) for each user at each race
  const userStarWins: { [userId: string]: { [raceId: string]: number } } = {};
  const userCumulativeStars: { [userId: string]: { [raceId: string]: number } } = {};
  
  processedLeaderboardData.forEach(user => {
    userStarWins[user.userId] = {};
    userCumulativeStars[user.userId] = {};
    let cumulativeStars = 0;
    
    completedRaces.forEach(race => {
      const userRaceData = user.raceBreakdown[race.id];
      const starWon = userRaceData?.isStarWinner ? 1 : 0;
      userStarWins[user.userId][race.id] = starWon;
      cumulativeStars += starWon;
      userCumulativeStars[user.userId][race.id] = cumulativeStars;
    });
  });

  // Second pass: build chart data with cumulative totals
  return completedRaces.map(race => {
    const raceData = { race: race.city, date: race.date, raceName: race.name };
    
    // Add cumulative stars for each user
    processedLeaderboardData.forEach(user => {
      raceData[user.username] = userCumulativeStars[user.userId][race.id] || 0;
    });
    
    return raceData;
  });
};

const generateStarWinsTableData = () => {
  const completedRaces = getCompletedRaces()
    .filter(race => race.results)
    .sort((a, b) => new Date(a.date).getTime() - new Date(b.date).getTime());

  if (completedRaces.length === 0) return { tableData: [], races: [] };

  // Calculate star wins and cumulative totals for each user
  const tableData = processedLeaderboardData.map(user => {
    const userData: any = {
      userId: user.userId,
      username: user.username,
      name: user.name
    };

    let cumulativeStars = 0;
    let totalStarWins = 0;
    completedRaces.forEach(race => {
      const userRaceData = user.raceBreakdown[race.id];
      const starWon = userRaceData?.isStarWinner ? 1 : 0;
      userData[race.id] = starWon;
      totalStarWins += starWon;
      cumulativeStars += starWon;
      userData[`${race.id}_cumulative`] = cumulativeStars;
    });

    // Use calculated total instead of user.totalStars
    userData.totalStars = totalStarWins;

    return userData;
  });

  return {
    tableData: tableData.sort((a, b) => b.totalStars - a.totalStars), // Sort by total stars
    races: completedRaces
  };
};
```

## Conclusion

The race-categorized leaderboard provides a comprehensive view of user performance while maintaining the simplicity and usability of the original design. The implementation now includes four distinct views:

1. **Overall Leaderboard**: Traditional ranking with total stars
2. **Recent Performance**: Last 5 races with visual score grid
3. **Race Breakdown**: Detailed race-by-race analysis with expandable sections
4. **Progress Chart**: Interactive visualization of cumulative star progression over time

The Progress Chart feature adds a powerful visual dimension to the leaderboard, allowing users to see their star accumulation trends and compare their progress with other users over the course of the season. The implementation is robust, performant, and ready for production use with full mobile responsiveness and real-time data synchronization.
